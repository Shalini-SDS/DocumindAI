**DocMind AI -AI-Powered Expense Verification & Fraud Detection Platform**
** Overview**

DocMind AI is an intelligent expense monitoring and auditing system designed for NGOs and small organizations. It automates expense verification using PaddleOCR-VL for document understanding and ERNIE 4.5 for semantic reasoning within a multi-agent architecture.
The system detects anomalies, prevents duplicate or fraudulent claims, and provides explainable audit insights through an interactive dashboard.

**Problem Statement**

Manual expense tracking using paper receipts and spreadsheets leads to:

Human errors and data inconsistency

Duplicate or fraudulent expense claims

Delayed audits and poor transparency

Reduced trust from donors and stakeholders

DocMind AI addresses these issues through AI-driven automation and explainable intelligence.

** Key Features**

**Multimodal OCR with PaddleOCR**
Extracts text, layout, and key fields from receipts and invoices.

 **ERNIE 4.5 Multi-Agent Reasoning System**
Specialized agents collaboratively:

Parse financial documents

Categorize expenses

Validate consistency

Generate audit explanations

**Fraud & Anomaly Detection**
Uses Isolation Forest to identify abnormal spending patterns.
**Explainable Audit Dashboard**
Displays flagged transactions with reasoning and confidence scores.
**Duplicate & Semantic Matching**
Detects duplicate claims even with vendor name or format variations.

**Multi-Agent Design (ERNIE 4.5)**
Agent	Responsibility
Document Understanding Agent	Extracts structured fields from OCR output
Expense Categorization Agent	Classifies expense type with reasoning
Fraud & Consistency Agent	Detects duplicates and inconsistencies
Audit Summary Agent	Generates human-readable audit explanations

Each agent is powered by ERNIE 4.5 and follows a single-responsibility design for clarity and explainability.
